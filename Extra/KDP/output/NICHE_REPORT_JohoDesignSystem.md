## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: GO** ✓

The 情報デザイン (Japanese Information Design) niche represents a **high-potential opportunity** with a unique market positioning. While the broader "information design" category has established competitors (Tufte, Meirelles), there is a significant gap for books that combine:

1. Japanese design philosophy with Western practical application
2. Mobile app/UI design with information design principles
3. A real-world case study demonstrating the complete system

The WeekGrid app provides an authentic, documented case study that no competitor can replicate.

## Unique Selling Proposition

### The 情報デザイン Difference

Unlike Western information design which evolved from statistics and academia (Tufte), 情報デザイン emerged from Japanese train systems, wayfinding, and everyday life optimization. Key principles:

| Principle | Western Approach | 情報デザイン Approach |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Clarity | More data is better | Essential data only |
| Aesthetics | Decoration vs function | Beauty IS function |
| Color | Decorative | Semantic meaning |
| Space | Fill the space | Ma (間) - purposeful emptiness |
| Borders | Optional styling | Structural definition |

### Case Study Advantage: WeekGrid

The book includes a **complete, documented case study** of the WeekGrid iOS app:

- Full design system specification
- Color semantics (Yellow=Today, Cyan=Events, Pink=Holidays, etc.)
- Border hierarchy system (1pt, 1.5pt, 2pt, 2.5pt, 3pt)
- Typography decisions
- Component library
- Before/after comparisons
- SwiftUI implementation code

**No competitor can replicate this authentic case study.**
