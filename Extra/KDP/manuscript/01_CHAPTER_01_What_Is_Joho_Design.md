# Chapter 1: What is Joho Dezain?

> "Every visual element must serve a clear informational purpose. Nothing is decorative—everything communicates."

---

## The Word Itself

*Joho Dezain* is written in Japanese using a mixed writing system:

- **Jo** — emotion, feeling, condition
- **Ho** — information, news, report
- **Dezain** — a phonetic loanword meaning "design," derived from the English word

The term combines two kanji characters expressing the concept of information (*joho*) with katakana script used to represent the modern borrowed term (*dezain*). This hybrid construction is standard in Japanese technical and design-related vocabulary.

Together, *joho* means "information" and *dezain* is "design." So *Joho Dezain* literally translates to "information design."

But the meaning runs deeper than the translation suggests.

In Japan, Joho Dezain isn't just about making information look good. It's about making information *work*. Every visual choice—every color, every border, every piece of spacing—must serve a functional purpose. Decoration for its own sake is not just discouraged; it's considered a design failure.

## A Different Philosophy

Western information design, pioneered by Edward Tufte and others, emerged from statistics and academia. Its primary concern is data density—how much information can be communicated accurately in a given space. Tufte famously criticized "chartjunk"—unnecessary visual elements that don't convey data.

Japanese information design shares this hatred of the unnecessary, but approaches the problem differently. Where Tufte's work is cerebral and analytical, Joho Dezain is environmental and intuitive. It evolved not in universities but in train stations, pharmacies, and convenience stores—places where millions of people need to extract critical information in seconds.

Consider the difference:

| Aspect | Western Information Design | Joho Dezain |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Origin | Academic/Statistical | Environmental/Commercial |
| Goal | Data density | Instant comprehension |
| Aesthetic | Clean, minimal | Bold, compartmentalized |
| Color use | Often monochrome | Semantic (meaning-laden) |
| Borders | Optional | Required |
| Primary medium | Print/Charts | Signage/Packaging |

## The Train Station Test

To understand Joho Dezain, stand in Shinjuku Station during rush hour.

Shinjuku is the world's busiest train station. Over 3.5 million passengers pass through daily—more than the entire population of Berlin. Dozens of train lines operated by different companies converge here. Miss your connection and you might be stranded on the wrong side of Tokyo.

In this chaos, there is no time for confusion. The wayfinding system must work instantly, for everyone: commuters who've made this journey a thousand times, tourists who don't speak Japanese, elderly passengers, children traveling alone.

Look at the signage. Notice what you see:

**Thick black borders** surround every piece of information. Each sign is a distinct unit, not bleeding into the next. Your eye knows exactly where one instruction ends and another begins.

**Color is semantic.** The Yamanote Line is always green. The Chuo Line is always orange. The Marunouchi Line is always red. These colors mean something. They're not decorative choices made by a designer who liked green—they're standardized identifiers that work across every map, every sign, every app.

**Compartmentalization.** Information is grouped into clear zones. Platform numbers are separate from line names. Directions are separate from warnings. You don't scan—you locate.

**High contrast.** Black on white. White on colored backgrounds. No subtle grays, no low-contrast combinations that might disappear under harsh fluorescent lighting or in peripheral vision.

This is Joho Dezain at scale. And the remarkable thing is: it works. Despite Shinjuku's complexity, most passengers navigate it successfully. The design doesn't make you think—it makes thinking unnecessary.

## The Bento Box Principle

Japanese design loves compartments.

Consider the bento box: a meal divided into distinct sections, each containing a different food. Rice here. Pickles there. Fish in its own space. Nothing touches. Nothing bleeds together.

This isn't just aesthetics—it's functional. A bento box is easy to eat because you always know what you're getting. Chopsticks go into one compartment, retrieve one type of food. No surprises, no mixing unless you choose to mix.

Joho Dezain applies this principle to visual information. Every piece of content gets its own compartment. These compartments have visible walls—borders—that separate them from their neighbors.

In Western design, we often let elements float in space, using proximity and alignment to show relationships. This works, but it requires cognitive processing. The viewer must interpret: "These elements are close together, so they're probably related."

In Joho Dezain, relationships are explicit. Elements in the same box are related. Elements in different boxes are different. The border tells you everything.

WESTERN APPROACH:
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Item A                                │
│  Description of item A                 │
│                                        │
│  Item B                                │
│  Description of item B                 │
│                                        │
│  Item C                                │
│  Description of item C                 │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

More lines? Yes. More clarity? Also yes.

## The Medicine Cabinet Lesson

Walk into any Japanese pharmacy and examine the OTC medicine packaging. Companies like Muhi, Rohto, and Salonpas have spent decades perfecting information design for their products.

Pick up a box of Salonpas pain relief patches. Notice:

**Compartmentalized information.** The product name is in one zone. The dosage instructions are in another. Warnings occupy their own clearly bordered section. Ingredients are grouped separately.

**Thick black borders.** Every zone has visible walls. Your eye doesn't have to guess where one piece of information ends and another begins.

**Color coding.** Different product lines use different colors consistently. The same colors appear on the box, the interior packaging, and the patches themselves.

**High contrast.** Text is black on white or white on bold colors. No subtle gradients, no text that might become illegible under store lighting.

**Purposeful color.** Red means warning. Yellow means attention. Blue means soothing/cooling. These associations are consistent across the entire product line—and indeed, across competing products. The colors are industry conventions, not brand decisions.

Now compare this to Western medicine packaging. Often beautiful. Often award-winning. Often confusing when you're sick at 3 AM and trying to figure out the correct dosage.

Japanese medicine packaging isn't more beautiful. It's more *usable*. And in design, usable is beautiful.

## Why Borders Matter

Borders are non-negotiable in Joho Dezain. This might seem excessive to Western designers trained in minimalism. Why add visual weight when you could use whitespace?

The answer lies in how we process visual information.

When elements have borders, your brain processes them as discrete objects. You don't need to calculate relationships—the borders define them. This is faster and requires less cognitive effort.

When elements float in space, your brain must do more work. You perceive the elements, calculate their proximity, infer their relationships, then interpret them. Each step takes time and mental energy.

In a train station during rush hour, you don't have time for that work. On a medicine box when you're sick, you don't have energy for that work. The borders do the work for you.

There's also a cultural dimension. In Japanese visual culture, boundaries are important. The concept of *ma*—negative space—is meaningful precisely because it exists between defined elements. Without borders, there is no *ma*. There's just... nothing.

## Semantic Color

In Joho Dezain, colors have meanings. They're not decorative—they're linguistic.

Consider these associations:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Yellow | Now, present, attention |
| Red | Warning, danger, Sunday |
| Green | Go, safe, money |
| Blue | Information, calm, water |
| Pink | Celebration, special |
| Orange | Energy, movement |
| Purple | Premium, mysterious |

These aren't arbitrary. They emerge from decades of use in Japanese signage, packaging, and interfaces. A yellow element demands immediate attention. A red element signals danger or prohibition. A green element indicates safety or permission.

When you use color semantically, you're not just styling—you're communicating. Users learn the color language and read your interface faster.

But this only works if you're consistent. The moment yellow sometimes means "now" and sometimes means "decorative highlight," your color language breaks. Users can't trust it, so they stop reading it.

In Joho Dezain, every color has exactly one meaning. Period.

## The Squircle

Look at the corners of Japanese interfaces. They're not sharp. They're not circular. They're *continuous*—a shape Apple calls the "squircle."

A squircle is a rounded rectangle where the curve flows smoothly from the straight edge. There's no mathematical discontinuity where the curve meets the line. Your eye follows the contour without interruption.

Compare:

```
STANDARD ROUNDED RECTANGLE:
The curve has a specific radius that meets the straight edge
at a defined point. There's a subtle "kink" at the junction.

SQUIRCLE (CONTINUOUS CORNERS):
The curve gradually transitions from straight to curved.
No junction point. No kink. Smooth the whole way.
```

Why does this matter? Because your eye notices discontinuities. Even tiny ones. A standard rounded rectangle creates four subtle tension points where the curves meet the edges. A squircle has none.

Apple popularized this in iOS, but the shape has deep roots in Japanese industrial design. Look at Japanese cars, appliances, packaging—continuous curves everywhere.

In code, the difference is simple:

```swift
// Standard rounded rectangle
RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12)

// Squircle (continuous corners)
RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12, style: .continuous)
```

One parameter. Enormous difference in feel.

## What Joho Dezain Is Not

**It's not minimalism.** Minimalism removes elements. Joho Dezain adds structure—borders, compartments, semantic color. A Joho Dezain interface often has more visual elements than a minimalist one.

**It's not flat design.** Flat design is about aesthetics—removing shadows, gradients, textures. Joho Dezain is about function—ensuring every visual element communicates something.

**It's not Japanese aesthetics.** You don't need cherry blossoms, paper textures, or kanji. Joho Dezain principles work in any visual language.

**It's not a trend.** The principles date back decades. They'll be valid decades from now. This isn't material design or skeuomorphism—it's not a style that will look dated. It's a methodology.

## Summary: The Seven Principles

1. **Everything has a border.** Every element is defined, contained, separate.

2. **Color is semantic.** Every color has one meaning. No decorative color.

3. **Compartmentalization.** Information is grouped into visible containers.

4. **High contrast.** Black on white. No subtle grays.

5. **Continuous corners.** Squircles, not rounded rectangles.

6. **Purposeful spacing.** Every gap means something. No arbitrary padding.

7. **Function over decoration.** If it doesn't communicate, remove it.

These principles are simple. Applying them consistently is the challenge. The rest of this book will show you how.
