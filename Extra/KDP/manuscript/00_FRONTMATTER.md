**A Practical Guide to Semantic Colors, Border Systems & UI Components with iOS App Case Study**

### About This Book

Every pixel in Japanese design serves a purpose. From Tokyo's legendary train signage to the meticulously organized OTC medicine packaging, Japan has perfected the art of visual communication. This book reveals the complete Joho Dezain (Jōhō Dezain) system and shows you how to apply it to modern app development.

This is not a theoretical design book. It's built around a real production iOS app called Onsen Planner. You'll see exactly how every principle translates to working code, with before-and-after comparisons that demonstrate the dramatic improvement Joho Dezain brings to user interfaces.

### How to Read This Book

**Part 1: Philosophy** establishes the foundation. Read this first to understand why Joho Dezain exists and what makes it different from Western design approaches.

**Part 2: The Design System** is your reference manual. Each chapter covers one aspect of the system in detail. You can read sequentially or jump to specific topics.

**Part 3: Component Library** provides production-ready patterns. Use this when building actual interfaces.

**Part 4: Case Study** demonstrates everything in context through the Onsen Planner app. This is where theory becomes practice.

**Part 5: Implementation** gives you the tools to apply Joho Dezain to your own projects, including code patterns and audit checklists.

This book would not exist without the design systems that inspired it: the Tokyo Metro wayfinding system, the packaging designers at Japanese pharmaceutical companies, and the engineers who built iOS and SwiftUI.
