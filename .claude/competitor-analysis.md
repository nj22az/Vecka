## What Makes Onsen Planner Unique

**No direct competitor** combines all of these:

1. **Week-first calendar** - ISO 8601 is the core, not an afterthought
2. **情報デザイン aesthetic** - Japanese information design with semantic colors, squircle borders, AMOLED black
3. **5-in-1 functionality** - Calendar + Expenses + Trips + Contacts + Special Days
4. **Swipe navigation** - Carousel between all sections (like Snapchat/TikTok)
5. **Multi-region holidays** - Sweden, US, Vietnam support
6. **No subscription** - Unlike Timepage, WeekCal premium

## Closest Competitors

| App | Similarity | Missing vs Onsen |
|-----|------------|------------------|
| **WeekCal** | Week numbers + holidays | No expenses, trips, contacts |
| **All-in-One Year Calendar SE** | Week numbers + birthdays | No expenses, trips |
| **Tripsy** | Expenses + trips | No week numbers, contacts |
| **Timepage** | Premium design | No week focus, expenses, trips |

## Market Gap

Onsen Planner fills a unique niche: **week-focused personal planner with expense tracking and a distinctive Japanese design language**.

No existing app combines:
- ISO 8601 week numbers as primary focus
- Expense tracking
- Trip planning
- Contact/birthday management
- Unique 情報デザイン aesthetic
